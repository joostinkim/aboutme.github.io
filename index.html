                <blockquote>
                    After graduating college, my resume was still so empty. I was lost 
                    to where I should start and how I should start my career path. I 
                    do not have any real life work experience and I have no incredible
                    projects on my resume for me to stand out at all. As of now, I am self teaching 
                    myself while creating projects to improve my resume. I know I want 
                    to become a software developer because I love learning new and different
                    ways of solving a problem. I am already a very logical person when it comes
                    to real life problems. Technology is always evolving and I think humans 
                    too should be evolving to be better.
